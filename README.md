# LearningPython

An interactive tutorial on learning Python closely following the Python docs, Python ver 3.9.4

This is an attempt at a interactive tutorial on learning Python closely following 'The Python Tutorial'
from the Python docs, Python ver 3.9.4

Please note that this repository contains works/software for which their respective licenses apply<br>
The license to this repository applies only to my original works for this repository<br>

Major credits for this repo should go to the Python Software Foundation and others (if applicable) involved
in the Python Docs. The contents of this repo are in very large part taken almost directly from The Python Docs
for Python version 3.9.4 and as such are applicable to the respective licenses (Python Software Foundation License
version 2 and The Zero Clause BSD License). For updated and accurate license information w.r.t. these contents
please refer the Python Docs and Licensing.

That said, I have tried to make my own additions, or omissions, from the content given in the docs when I felt it
would add value, both in the form of explanations of particular concepts, and/or code examples. I can only hope
these will be meaningful in some capacity.

The order in which the tutorials occur in the Python Docs is as follows (only of the parts I have included
in this repo):
<ul>
  <li>More control flow tools</li>
  <li>Data structures</li>
  <li>Modules</li>
  <li>Input and Output</li>
  <li>Errors and Exceptions</li>
  <li>Classes</li>
</ul>

However, I am of the opinion that the part for Classes would be better to do before the one for Errors and 
Exceptions and recommend it.

I have made it a point to try my best to stay in the 79 characters per line limit as recommended by PEP-8
so that it can be used in split screen on half the screen, which I often find the need to use and am sure
many others do too.

Please note that this is not meant to be a complete overview of the Python Language, nor is it mean to be a
complete overview of the Python Docs, or 'The Python Tutorial' from the Python Docs.<br>
What this is, is a documentation of what I considered particularly helpful to start one's journey in Python
compiled with much ease thanks to the fantastic Python docs, but with my own edits, comments, and a bit of
everything added in.

Perhaps this can also be used as a quick reference in an interactive environment when you need to just
quickly look up _that_ particular topic, atleast I do hope to make some use of it in that fashion.

I will try to re-visit this in the future in an attempt to make it more complete if possible, but as it stands
right now, is a completion of what I had in mind when I started off putting this together, and what I consider
the ones of primary importance.

I would encourage you to experiment, play around with the code, poke it in different ways (though with
appropriate caution!).

Absolutely welcome contributions, discussions, and/or suggestions!
(Though no guarantees about how quick I'll be able to process them :" )

I can only hope this effort will add some value to your journey of Learning.

# All the very best! :)
